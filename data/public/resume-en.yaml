role: "Technical Writer"
summary: |
  I am a Technical Writer with nearly four years of experience (ten years of documentation practice overall), focused on API documentation and hands-on tutorials for end users. I partner closely with product owners and developers to keep technical communication consistent across initiatives. I also own the Developer Portal, keeping content current and data-informed so it reflects what our developer community needs. I treat documentation like code with the same care. I am an emerging leader with two years of experience growing a team. Right now I am deepening my knowledge of AI tools.
